![](Coverpage.png)

## 1. Introduction
This project explores a dataset of over 106,000 used car sales across eleven major car brands in the UK. The aim is to identify patterns, performance trends, and business drivers within the secondhand automobile market. The dataset covers key vehicle attributes such as fuel type, mileage, transmission, engine size, tax, price, model, age, and brand. By analyzing this data, the goal is to generate actionable insights that can inform sales strategy, investment decisions, and operational focus in the used car sector.

## 2. Statement of the Problem
The used car market is vast and dynamic, but decision-making is often hindered by a lack of structured insights into what drives sales, pricing, and revenue. Businesses and investors need clarity on factors that influence profitabilityâ€”such as brand, vehicle age, fuel type, and transmission type. This analysis seeks to close that gap by revealing the trends that influence revenue and customer behavior in the used car industry.

## 3. Data Source

- Target High-Performing Brands and Models: Focus marketing and procurement efforts on high-revenue brands like Mercedes and models like the C-Class.

- Optimize Fuel Type Offerings: Maintain a strong inventory of Diesel and Petrol cars but monitor emerging interest in Hybrid and Electric cars.

- Capitalize on Peak Sales Years: Analyze what drove the 2019 peak and replicate successful strategies from that period.

- Transmission Preferences: Prioritize stocking Semi-Auto and Manual transmission vehicles based on revenue performance.

- Age-Optimized Inventory: Target sourcing and reselling cars within the 6-8 year age range, which generated the majority of revenue.

- Improve Data Completeness: A significant portion of MPG data is missing; improving data quality can enhance future analysis.
